- 👋 Hi, I’m @panashPanda
- 👀 I’m interested in UI/UX design and research as well as front-end development.
- 🌱 I’m currently in university juggling internship, thesis, and a bunch of online courses. Hopefully, I don't go bald from all the stress.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on GitHub!
- 📫 How to reach me - I am trying to detox myself from social media. So I don't have any socials atm, but you can reach me through Behance - Youssef Hisham.
